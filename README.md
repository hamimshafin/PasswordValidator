## Summary
This is a program called Password Validator. It
uses OOP logic to validate different passwords with
different requirements. It also brings in the use of 
super classes, sub classes, and functions.

## How it Works
This program uses four different files to run.
Password_tester calls all the function and is where
main is stored. Password_validator stores the 
PasswordValidator class which validates the passwords
using certain requirements. Adv_password_validator is 
very similar to password_validator just more advanced.
Password_exception stores an exception class that is used
for errors.
